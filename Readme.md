## Reflection

  This a 1 week project made with some of my collegues from my web development course. It was meant to help us develop both soft skills, working as a group, and Redux state management.
  This project was amazing mainly because it was the bigger project I have built with a group so far (2020/11/10), that means that it was a challenge to organize and keep the code clean as 4 people worked on it. I can also point that it was my first project where I used SASS library, which was a very enriching experience.
  We have had 2 main problems during development:
  1. Standardization of Redux state, so that every person in the group could access and manage Redux without breaking other requirements;
  2. Manage localStorage to create a persistent state.

  As described above, to create this project we have used mainly: React + Redux, SASS and RTL.
